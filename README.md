# ebalo

Enterprise Business Automation of Labor Operations - an open source service automation platform.

## What?

A platform for service providing and management automation. Imagine having access to a service you can resell or hosting a service. You want to be able to provide it to your clients and preferrably - automagically, right? Well, this is where our product takes scene. For you can provide in EBALO!

## How?

Dunno, lol. We\'re on early stages of early stages. Everything is possible. But there are a few definite principles that will govern this project until its eventual death.

### Principles

 1. **Build a tool, not solution.** You want to customize it - it\'s your problem. We don\'t care how pretty you want your EBALO to be, we want to make it possible to provide in EBALO. Thus it is a set of isolated stateless tools, not a clusterfuck of closed source monolith with ten levels of abstraction and as much of promised features, as unfixed bugs.

 2. **Fuck billing.** We are here to provide in EBALO, not count your precious coins! You are doing it in Excel already anyway, we're not going to reinvent Excel for you. Now think how are you going to integrate with EBALO, smartass.

 3. **Manual work is for pussies.** Let\'s face it, you don\'t want to provide in EBALO for all of your clients manually or spend countless man-days configuring EBALO instead of providing in it. You want to press one button, and have everything work for you. So do we. You will be able to continuously provide in EBALO once the initial config is complete.

## Roadmap

 * Build EBALO prototype
 * Make it possible to provide in EBALO prototype
 * Provide in EBALO
